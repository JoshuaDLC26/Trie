# Trie
Implementation of a Trie(Prefix Tree) Data Structure. Created as an assignment for my data structures class. 
The Trie can perform a variety of methods such as wildCardMatch(String s) which returns an arrayList of all the Words in the Trie which
match the String s, allFind(String target, ArrayList<String> searchFor) (It returns all of the words from
searchFor that appear anywhere in target), and AllPrefixMatch(return a list of all the Strings in the Trie that are prefixes of s. If the Trie contains HE, HELLO and HELLOS
and s = HELLOT, the ArrayList should contain HE and HELLO).
